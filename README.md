## Overview
## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
One major issue I ran into was clearing the values of the numbers in the textboxes, but I could work through it by resetting each of them to default values.
```js
document.querySelector(".reset").addEventListener("click", () =>{
    total_bill.value = '';
    total_people.value = '';
    tip.textContent = '0.00';
    amount.textContent = '0.00';
})
```
### Continued development
I'm going to keep my focus on my frontend. I want to build scalable and functional sites from scratch. I would start by solidifying my JavaScript and then diving into frameworks.
